Library Management System:


I need a system to manage my library's books and CDs (items), authors, artists, and members. 
Each item should have a unique ID and a title
A book has an ISBN and a referenced Author.
A CD h    as an amount of tracks and a referenced artist
Authors and artists should have a name, nationality, and birth date. 
Members should have a name, address, and phone number.
A member can rent maximum 3 items at once
Create a function that retrieves all books written by a certain author. 
Create a function that retrieves all members who have borrowed 3 items
Create a function that retrieves all authors and artists who were born in the 90â€™s
